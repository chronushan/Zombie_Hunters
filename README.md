# Zombie_Hunters
SKKU Graduation Project

Game Overview:
The game concept is based on Vampire Survivors, but with some modifications and additions. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world where zombies have taken over and humans are either enslaved or hunted. The player controls one of the survivors who has managed to escape from a zombie camp and must fight their way through the monsters to find a safe haven.

The game is a 2D scroller action game with roguelike elements. The player can move up, down, left, right and attack with their weapon. The weapons can be upgraded with the level up system by experience points on killing the monsters. The player has a health bar that decreases when they take damage from enemy’s contact or their projectiles. If the health bar reaches zero, the player dies and the game is over. If the player survives for two and a half minutes, game is considered a cleared. The game has permadeath, which means that the player cannot save or load their progress. If the player dies, they have to start from the beginning of the game.
